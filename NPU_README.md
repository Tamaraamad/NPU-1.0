# NPU Backend Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architectural decisions, security considerations, scalability strategies, and design principles applied in the development of the NPU (Nice Part Usage) backend system.

## üîê Security and User Privacy Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization**: 
  - All endpoints are protected using FastAPI dependencies to ensure only authenticated users can access or modify data.
  - Role-based access control is enforced (e.g., superusers vs. regular users).

- **Data Ownership**:
  - Each NPU creation and score is associated with a `user_id` to ensure traceability and enforce access control.

- **Minimal Exposure**:
  - Only necessary fields are exposed through Pydantic schemas.
  - Sensitive data is excluded from API responses.

- **Validation & Serialization**:
  - Pydantic schemas with `orm_mode` ensure safe and consistent data handling.
  - Input validation prevents malformed or malicious data from being processed.

- **Static File Security**:
  - The `app/static` directory is used for serving static assets and is protected from directory traversal vulnerabilities.

## üìà Scalability and Bottlenecks

- **Scalability**:
  - FastAPI supports asynchronous request handling for high concurrency.
  - SQLModel and SQLAlchemy provide efficient ORM capabilities.
  - Dockerized architecture allows horizontal scaling via container orchestration.

- **Potential Bottlenecks**:
  - **Database Load**: Queries like `search_by_tag` may slow down with large datasets. Indexing and normalization can help.
  - **Image Storage**: If storing images locally, consider using a CDN or object storage like AWS S3.
  - **Scoring System**: High write frequency to the `Score` table may require caching or batching.

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Use pagination for listing endpoints.
  - Add indexes on frequently queried fields.
  - Implement rate limiting and caching for public endpoints.

## üß† Design Principles Applied

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Models, schemas, CRUD logic, and routes are modular and isolated.

- **Modularity**:
  - Each feature (e.g., items, NPU) is encapsulated in its own module for maintainability.

- **Reusability**:
  - Shared dependencies and schemas are reused across endpoints.

- **Security by Design**:
  - Authentication and authorization are integrated from the start.
  - ORM and schema validation reduce the attack surface.

- **Scalability Awareness**:
  - Docker and FastAPI provide a foundation for scalable deployment.

## üìÅ Directory Structure Highlights

- `models/npu.py`: SQLModel definitions for NPUCreation and Score.
- `schemas/npu.py`: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation.
- `routes/npu.py`: API endpoints for creating, scoring, and searching NPU creations.
- `api/deps.py`: Shared dependencies for database sessions and user authentication.

## ‚úÖ Summary

The NPU backend is designed with security, scalability, and modularity in mind. It leverages FastAPI, SQLModel, and Docker to provide a robust and extensible foundation for a social platform centered around creative  part usage.
